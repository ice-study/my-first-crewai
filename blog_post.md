### Title: The Biggest Box Office Flops of 2024: What Went Wrong?

2024 was a challenging year for Hollywood as it tried to bounce back from the pandemic and navigate the aftermath of 2023's Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild of America strikes. While there were moments of triumph, like the success of "Dune: Part Two," many films failed to make a mark. Here, we dissect the biggest box office flops of 2024, exploring what went wrong and what lessons can be learned.

#### 1. I.S.S.
**Studio:** Bleecker Street

**Budget:** Less than $20 million

**Box Office Earnings:** $6.5 million

Released in January, "I.S.S." was a space-set thriller directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite. Despite its unique premise and reasonable budget, it couldn't compete with other releases like "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom" and "Wonka." Opening to a mere $3 million, the film struggled to attract audiences, ultimately earning just $6.5 million. Mixed reviews and poor timing contributed to its downfall. While it may recoup some losses through VOD and streaming, its theatrical performance was a disappointment.

#### 2. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire
**Studio:** Sony Pictures

**Budget:** $100 million

**Box Office Earnings:** $176.6 million

As a sequel to 2021's "Ghostbusters: Afterlife," "Frozen Empire" aimed to capitalize on nostalgia by bringing the action back to New York City. However, it failed to generate significant interest, opening to $45 million and ending its run with $176.6 million worldwide. Despite its bigger budget, it performed almost identically to its predecessor, leading to losses for Sony. While it pushed the "Ghostbusters" franchise past the $1 billion mark globally, it likely marks the end of this incarnation of the series.

#### 3. Arthur the King
**Studio:** Lionsgate

**Budget:** $19 million

**Box Office Earnings:** $31 million

Mark Wahlberg's "Arthur the King" had all the ingredients for a hit: a compelling true story, a cute dog, and a talented cast. However, it was released amidst blockbusters like "Dune: Part Two" and "Kung Fu Panda 4," leading to a modest $7.6 million opening. Despite decent holds, it couldn't overcome its slow start, earning just $31 million worldwide. With limited international appeal and few merchandising opportunities, it was a financial disappointment.

#### 4. Drive-Away Dolls
**Studio:** Focus Features

**Budget:** $20 million

**Box Office Earnings:** $6.7 million

Ethan Coen's solo directorial debut, "Drive-Away Dolls," failed to capture the magic of his previous collaborations with his brother Joel. Released in late February, the road trip comedy opened to a dismal $2.4 million, ultimately earning just $6.7 million worldwide. Mixed reviews and poor timing contributed to its poor performance. Focus Features will now rely on VOD to recoup some of its losses.

#### 5. Madame Web
**Studio:** Sony Pictures

**Budget:** $80 million

**Box Office Earnings:** $100 million

"Madame Web," a Spider-Man spin-off starring Dakota Johnson, was Sony's attempt to expand its Marvel universe. However, it opened to just $15.3 million and faced stiff competition from "Bob Marley: One Love." Terrible reviews further hampered its performance, leading to a worldwide gross of just $100 million. While it wasn't a massive-budget disaster, it was enough to put the future of Sony's Spider-Man spin-off universe in jeopardy.
