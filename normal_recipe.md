- Salt to taste

**Preparation Instructions:**

*For the Moussaka:*
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Slice the eggplants into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Sprinkle with salt and let sit for 30 minutes to draw out moisture. Rinse and pat dry.
3. In a large skillet, heat some olive oil over medium-high heat. Fry the eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides. Set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.
4. In the same skillet, add a bit more olive oil and sauté the chopped onion until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.
5. Add the ground meat and cook until browned. Stir in the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes until the mixture thickens.
6. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for a couple of minutes. Gradually add the milk, whisking continuously until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly before stirring in the beaten eggs, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
7. In a baking dish, layer half of the eggplants, cover with the meat sauce, and then add another layer of eggplants. Pour the bechamel sauce over the top and spread it evenly. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes until the top is golden brown and the moussaka is bubbly. Let it rest for 15 minutes before serving.

*For the Greek Salad:*
1. In a large bowl, combine the tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, bell pepper, feta cheese, and olives.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper.
3. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.

*For the Tzatziki Sauce:*
1. In a medium bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar, dill, and salt. Mix well.
2. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

**Serving Suggestions:**
1. Serve the moussaka as the main dish, accompanied by the refreshing Greek salad on the side.
2. Offer tzatziki sauce as a delicious dip or side sauce, perfect with warm pita bread.
3. Pair the meal with a glass of chilled Greek white wine, such as Assyrtiko, to enhance the dining experience.
4. For dessert, consider serving baklava or Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts to complete the meal.
